### How to Run:
To run the website we used XAMPP to be able to fix the issues between php and JS. We also used the postgresql database management tool to be able to store our information. The database was named Emergency with a table for the patients waitlist as well as the user accounts.
To be able to used postgresql alongside XAMPP it is important to modify the parameters of posgresql within the php regulation page (.ini extension). Once modified we are able to use postgresql in our website.
